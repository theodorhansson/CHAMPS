Items marked with {M} are mandatory, {O} optional.


```toml
.[INT_sphere]
Type = "ophir_IS6_D_UV"
Range = 2
Min_measure_time = 0.2 Â # How long to wait between new data to arrive from sphere
Wavelength = 5
```
## INT_sphere {M}
The measurement dict contains all info for your specific device. It must always be present! 
**Note:** you may name it someting else:
``` TOML
P_unit = "The_best_P_unit"
...

.[The_best_P_unit]
#Config
```
